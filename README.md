# Bookshelf Frontend React App

This repository, along with the Bookshelf_Backend Rails API, is a very simplified version of the Goodreads website(https://www.goodreads.com/) and mobile application. It will allow users to create bookshelves to keep track of books via "shelves" that they can name however they like, and add or delete books to those shelves as needed. 

# Installation

To install this app, fork and clone this repository from GitHub. CD into the bookshelf_frontend folder and run npm install. Run npm start to start a web server and navigate to localhost:3001 in your web browser. You will also need to have the corresponding Rails API running on localhost:3000. You can get that repo here: https://github.com/priscillahuynh/bookshelf_frontend
